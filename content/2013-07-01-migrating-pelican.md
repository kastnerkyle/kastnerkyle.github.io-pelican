<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->
After attending SciPy this year, I have become firmly convinced that my blog needs a new home and a new look. 
Looking around, Pelican seems to be a popular choice as a Python static site generator, and it has good integration with
IPython. With these things in mind, I will slowly begin moving some of the more code based posts from [kkjkok.blogspot.com](http://kkjkok.blogspot.com)
to this site, as well as posting new material as it arises.
