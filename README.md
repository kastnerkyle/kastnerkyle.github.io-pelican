This site is largely based off of the work of jakevdp - see his blog 
[Pythonic Perambulations](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonicPerambulations)
for more details. I hope to contribute back once I get my blog transitioned
from its old [home](https://kkjkok.blogspot.com)

To generate the website, it is necessary to clone my pelican-plugins 
and pelican-themes forks. In addition, you will also need:

pip install pelican
pip install markdown
sudo apt-get install pandoc

With this, it should be possible to regenerate my website, found at
kastnerkyle.github.io.
